**Welcome to the Time Series Jungle!**

Have you ever looked at a graph or chart and felt like it was telling a story? That's the beauty of time series data - it captures the ebb and flow of the world around us, from stock prices to weather patterns to website traffic. Here at this little corner of the internet, I'm obsessed with unraveling those stories using the power of machine learning.

This blog is my playground for exploring the fascinating world of time series modeling. We'll dive into different techniques, wrestle with forecasting challenges, and hopefully, unearth some hidden insights along the way. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just curious about the magic behind predictions, join me on this journey through the time machine. All projects, ideas and progress are documented in the [blog posts section](https://cliffordhu.github.io/year-archive/)
